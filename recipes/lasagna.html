    <h1>Chicken Marsala Milanese</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I've wanted to do an updated video on chicken Marsala for quite a while now, which is one of my favorite dishes of all time. But whenever I'd start the process, I'd remember some other chicken recipe I hadn't filmed yet, and it would get pushed off the schedule. That was about to happen yet again, as it was brought to my attention that I've never posted a video for chicken Milanese, but instead I decided to mash up these two iconic dishes, and I couldn't have been happier with the results.</p>

    <p>For me, there's nothing better than a thin, crispy, pan-fried cutlet of meat, unless that already awesome edible is topped with a rich, savory mushroom Marsala sauce, which takes everything up to a whole new level. By the way, the sauce being discussed will take anything up to a whole new level. So even if pan-fried, crispy cutlets aren't your thing, I hope the sauce makes it into your permanent recipe repertoire.</p>
